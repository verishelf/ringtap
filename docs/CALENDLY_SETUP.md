# Calendly Link (Edit Profile)

RingTap uses a **manual Calendly link** stored in your profile theme. No OAuth, sync, or webhooks are required.

## Setup

1. Create a Calendly account at [calendly.com](https://calendly.com) and get your scheduling link (e.g. `https://calendly.com/your-username`).
2. In the RingTap app, go to **Profile** → **Edit**.
3. In the **Calendly** field, enter your link (e.g. `calendly.com/username` or `https://calendly.com/username`).
4. Save your profile.

The **Schedule** button on your public profile (website and app preview) will open this link when visitors tap it.
